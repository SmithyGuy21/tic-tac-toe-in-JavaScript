# Tic-Tac-Toe in JavaScript

## Project Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript and React. It serves as a learning tool for JavaScript and React, created during a nonprofit internship. The code structure is based on the Create React App template.

## Getting Started
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to play the game.

## Created with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with and heavily inspired by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.

## Game Features

- Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a dynamic board.
- Time-travel feature allowing you to revisit and undo moves.
- Highlights the winning squares when a player wins.
- Options to reverse the order of moves.

## How to Play
Click on an empty square to make a move. The game alternates between "X" and "O." The first player to get three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.
